# attiny
ATtiny microcontroller support for the Arduino IDE. 

This is cloned from David Mellis's ATtiny configuration for 
Arduino 1.6.x with support added for locally home-brewed [development 
boards](http://programmablehardware.blogspot.ie/search/label/t84db) which use the [TSB 
bootloader](http://jtxp.org/tech/tinysafeboot_en.htm).
